    In the first line We have "!DOCTYPE html", which declares the document type

    "html" tag, which defines the whole html document.

    Then I have used the "head" contains meta information about the HTML page such as title of the webpage(using "title" tag, I have give the title to the webpage I created).

    "body" tag define the document's body, it is used for all the content we want to show on our webpage.

    "h1" is a heading tag which is used to give headings to the content, here "h1" is used for the heading named 'The Gallery Cafe'(there are 6 of them, h1 is used for the most important headings, and it keeps reducing to h6).

    Then there's the "hr" tag which is used to basically draw a separator or a horizontal line.

    Again a heading tags is used, "h4" is used for heading but it is smaller and used for less important than the "h3" headings.

    Then comes the "p" tag (paragraph tag), which is used to write paragraphs or any kind of text or lines. There is one more tag used inside the paragraph tag, which is the "strong" tag, it is used for to bold the text and make it important, it also helps improve the SEO rating of the webpage.

    After that, two "a" tag are used, which is the anchor tag and it is used to define the hyperlink. we can wrap any text inside the anchor tag to make it work as a link and the "href" attribute inside the tag holds the url of the page the link goes to.
    
    Again there's the "hr" tag which is used to basically draw a separator or a horizontal line.

    "h1" tag is used again to define a heading and then there is one more "h4" tag for a subheading.

    Then I have created an ordered list using the "ol" tag and inside it I have used the "li" tag to define the data or items of the list.

    There's the "hr" tag which is used to basically draw a separator or a horizontal line.

    Then there is one more "h4" tag for a subheading and then I have created an ordered list using the "ol" tag and inside it I have used the "li" tag to define the data or items of the list.

    The above step is repeated again for a subheading and an ordered list.

    Then there are two "hr" tags, which is used to a horizontal line.
